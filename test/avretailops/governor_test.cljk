;; ----------------------------- self-trip regression -----------------------------
;;
;; A known bug class in this actor fleet: the governor's own
;; scope-exclusion term list is sometimes phrased as a bare noun (e.g.
;; "warranty" or "claim"), which then accidentally matches inside the
;; mock advisor's own DEFAULT rationale/disclaimer text for a legitimate,
;; allowed proposal -- causing the actor to self-block its own happy
;; path. This is a dedicated regression test: every op the default mock
;; advisor can generate, with default (non-`out-of-scope?`) request
;; patches, must NEVER trip `:scope-excluded` or `:op-not-allowed`.
